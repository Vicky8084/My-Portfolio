## About

This portfolio is a dynamic and responsive website designed to highlight my journey as a **Software Engineer**. It provides a comprehensive overview of my expertise in **Java, Data Structures & Algorithms, and the Spring ecosystem**, alongside my proficiency in frontend web technologies. My goal is to build robust, scalable, and impactful solutions to real-world problems.

## Design Philosophy

This portfolio is crafted with a focus on **cleanliness, professionalism, and readability**, ensuring a positive user experience.

* **Color Palette:** A balanced mix of `--primary-color` (deep blue: `#0f3460`), `--secondary-color` (vibrant accent red: `#e94560`), `--dark-color` (dark background: `#1a1a2e`), and `--light-bg-color` (light gray: `#f0f4f8`) creates a modern and professional aesthetic.
* **Typography:**
    * **Headings (`Raleway`):** Used for prominent titles like the logo and hero section heading, providing a distinct and bold visual appeal.
    * **Body Text (`Montserrat`):** Applied to most of the content for excellent readability across various screen sizes.
    * **Font Sizes:** A carefully chosen scale of font sizes, managed via **CSS variables** (e.g., `--font-size-xs` to `--font-size-xxl`), ensures a clear hierarchy and optimal legibility on different devices. This approach allows for easy, consistent scaling across the entire site.
* **Layout:** A responsive grid system and flexible box layouts (`flexbox`) are employed to ensure the content adapts gracefully to diverse screen resolutions, from large desktops to small mobile devices.
* **Interactivity:** Subtle hover effects, smooth transitions, and a responsive navigation menu enhance the user interaction. The projects section features a `Swiper.js` carousel for an engaging Browse experience.

## Features

* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for seamless viewing across all devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
* **Hero Section:** An engaging introduction to my profile with a compelling call to action.
* **About Me:** Detailed information about my background, education, and passions.
* **Skills Section:** A clear breakdown of my technical proficiencies, including programming languages, web technologies, and databases, presented in an easy-to-digest card format.
* **Projects Showcase:** A dynamic slider (powered by Swiper.js) featuring key projects with concise descriptions and direct links to their GitHub repositories.
* **Contact Form:** A functional contact form with a success pop-up message for user feedback, ensuring a smooth communication channel.
* **Social Links:** Easy access to my professional social media profiles.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using standard web technologies:

* **HTML5:** For structuring the content.
* **CSS3:** For styling and layout, including responsive design. Custom CSS variables are extensively used for maintainability.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For interactive elements, dynamic content, mobile navigation toggle, and contact form handling.
* **Swiper.js:** A modern, highly customizable touch slider library used for the projects section carousel.
* **Font Awesome:** For scalable vector icons.

## Installation and Setup

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Vicky8084/My-Portfolio.git](https://github.com/Vicky8084/My-Portfolio.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd My-Portfolio
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. All necessary CSS and JavaScript files are linked locally.

**Note on Contact Form:** The contact form currently simulates a successful submission and does not send actual emails. For a live deployment, you would need to integrate a backend service (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms, or a custom API endpoint) to handle form submissions. Update the `action` attribute in the contact form in `index.html` accordingly.
